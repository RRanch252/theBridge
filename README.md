# The Bridge Investor Deck

This is the investor presentation deck for The Bridge - a music-led enterprise using the power of music to build connections across conflict zones.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload these files to your repository:
   - `index.html` - Main HTML file
   - `styles.css` - All CSS styles
   - `script.js` - JavaScript for navigation and functionality
   - `slides.html` - Contains all slide content
   - `complete-styles.css` - Full CSS from the original deck

3. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Save

4. Your deck will be available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## Important Notes

1. **Copy all slide content**: You need to copy all the slide HTML from your complete deck into `slides.html`, removing only the outer `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

2. **Complete CSS**: The `styles.css` file contains basic styles. You should also create a `complete-styles.css` file with ALL the CSS from your original deck for all slide types.

3. **Responsive Design**: The deck automatically scales to fit different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.
